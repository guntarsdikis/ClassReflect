# Apply Template Progress Tracking - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

   - Shows progress bar (0-100%)
   - Displays current stage and message
   - Shows template name being used
   - Auto-closes when complete

2. **Status Polling**
   - Polls `/api/jobs/:jobId/status` every 2 seconds
   - Tracks analysis progress through stages
   - Updates UI in real-time

3. **User Feedback**

## Technical Details

### Progress Stages

| Stage | Percent | Message |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `queued` | 0% | "Waiting to start..." |
| `transcribing` | 30-60% | "Transcribing audio..." (shouldn't happen for apply template) |
| `analyzing` | 60-100% | "Analyzing with [Template]..." |
| `completed` | 100% | "Analysis complete!" |
| `failed` | 0% | Error message |

### API Flow

1. Frontend calls `POST /api/analysis/apply-template`
   - Creates analysis job in database
   - Returns immediately (doesn't wait)

2. Frontend starts polling `GET /api/jobs/:jobId/status`
   - Polls every 2 seconds
   - Gets current progress percentage
   - Gets stage (analyzing, completed, etc.)
   - Gets template name being used

3. Backend processes analysis
   - Updates `analysis_jobs` table with progress
   - Updates `audio_jobs.analysis_status`
   - Stores results when complete

4. Frontend detects completion
   - Shows success notification
   - Closes modal
   - Refreshes recordings list
   - New analysis results now available

### Modal Behavior

- **During Analysis**: Modal cannot be closed (prevents accidental navigation away)
- **Progress Display**: Shows animated progress bar with percentage
- **Stage Info**: Displays current stage and descriptive message
- **Template Badge**: Shows which template is being applied
- **Auto-Close**: Automatically closes when analysis completes
- **Error Handling**: Shows error message if analysis fails

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Real-Time Feedback** - Users see exactly what's happening
‚úÖ **Professional UX** - Matches modern app behavior
‚úÖ **Confidence** - Users know the system is working
‚úÖ **Progress Tracking** - Can estimate time remaining
‚úÖ **Error Visibility** - Clear messages if something fails
‚úÖ **Automatic Updates** - List refreshes when done

## Notes

- The progress tracking uses the same `/api/jobs/:jobId/status` endpoint as the upload wizard
- Analysis typically takes 30-90 seconds depending on transcript length
- The modal prevents closing during analysis to avoid confusion
- If analysis fails, user can retry by applying template again
