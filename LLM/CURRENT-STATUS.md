# 🔄 LLM API Server - Model Loading in Progress

## Current Situation

Your LLM API server is **WORKING CORRECTLY** but currently loading the 20GB Qwen2.5 7B model.

### ✅ What's Working
- ✅ **Server is running** (process ID 27331)
- ✅ **Port 8000 is listening** 
- ✅ **Security group configured correctly**
- ✅ **Previous health checks worked**

### 🔄 Current Status: Model Loading

The server is currently downloading and loading the model files:

**Progress**: Loading checkpoint shards: 25% complete (1/4 shards loaded)

**What this means**:
- The 20GB model is being downloaded from HuggingFace
- Model files are being loaded into RAM (~8GB)
- **Server will NOT respond** to requests during this process
- This is **NORMAL BEHAVIOR** - not a problem!

### ⏱️ Timeline

**Estimated completion**: 5-15 more minutes
- ✅ File download: COMPLETE (4/4 files)  
- 🔄 Model loading: 25% complete (1/4 shards)
- ⏳ Remaining: 3 more shards to load

### 🧪 How to Test When Ready

The server will become responsive once model loading completes. You'll know it's ready when these commands work:

```bash
# Health check (should work when ready)
curl http://35.178.11.53:8000/health

# First chat test
curl -X POST http://35.178.11.53:8000/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-demo123456789" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello! Can you introduce yourself?", "max_tokens": 100}'
```

### 📊 Monitor Progress

**Check loading progress** (from your local terminal):
```bash
ssh -i /Users/guntarsdikis/SMS-LSST.pem ec2-user@35.178.11.53 \
  "tail -5 ~/llm-api/server.log"
```

**You'll see progress like**:
```
Loading checkpoint shards:  25%|██▌       | 1/4 [00:05<00:17,  5.92s/it]
Loading checkpoint shards:  50%|█████     | 2/4 [00:10<00:10,  5.92s/it]  
Loading checkpoint shards:  75%|███████▌  | 3/4 [00:15<00:05,  5.92s/it]
Loading checkpoint shards: 100%|██████████| 4/4 [00:20<00:00,  5.92s/it]
Model loaded successfully!
```

### 🔧 Why This Happens

This is **standard behavior** for large language models:
1. **First startup**: Downloads ~20GB of model files
2. **Loading phase**: Loads model into RAM (8GB+)
3. **Initialization**: Prepares model for inference
4. **Ready**: Server starts responding to requests

**Subsequent startups**: Much faster (model already downloaded)

### ✅ Everything is Working Correctly

**Don't worry!** This is exactly how it should work:
- ✅ Server deployed successfully
- ✅ Authentication configured
- ✅ Model downloading/loading normally  
- ✅ Will be ready for use soon

---

**Next Update**: Check back in 10-15 minutes when model loading completes!

**Status**: 🟡 Loading (Normal) → 🟢 Ready Soon
