[00:00:08.720 - 00:00:18.680] Okay, it's four of us. Let's try to put our phones away in the box. How do you see the
[00:00:18.680 - 00:00:19.440] screen, Anna,
[00:00:21.440 - 00:00:23.280] in case you can actually
[00:00:26.650 - 00:00:28.330] use the presentation? As always.
[00:00:29.930 - 00:00:30.330] But
[00:00:33.610 - 00:00:43.290] we will need. We will need paper today. Either notebooks. Yeah. Or separate paper. But at the end we're gonna use
[00:00:44.730 - 00:00:54.500] phones to take a picture of it and upload it to Total. Okay. So we will have. Sorry. We will write. Yes, we will write. Who
[00:00:54.580 - 00:01:04.260] listened to the podcast generated by AI on teams? No one. I didn't see. I didn't think it was compulsory.

## Prompt Payload Sent
```text
You are an expert instructional coach analyzing a classroom transcript using a dynamic evaluation template.

PRIMARY GOAL
- Provide constructive, motivational, evidence-based coaching feedback for the teacher.
- This report is for growth, not punishment.
- Numbers are for admin tracking; narrative must be teacher-facing and improvement-focused.

STYLE
- Coaching voice: warm, specific, encouraging; use direct address (“You did…”, “Next time, consider…”).
- Ground every claim in transcript evidence (quotes + timestamps).
- For each criterion’s “feedback”, write 6 sentences (not fewer) and ≤120 words.
- Avoid generic advice; always include a micro-action and an exemplar script.

MOTIVATIONAL SCORING RUBRIC
- 55–65 = Baseline / Absent but improvable → Give credit, explain one easy way to add it next lesson.
- 66–75 = Emerging → Praise attempt, suggest refinement.
- 76–85 = Developing → Present but inconsistent; provide a coaching move.
- 86–92 = Strong → Consistently applied; celebrate and refine.
- 93–100 = Exemplary → Best practice; affirm and encourage sharing.

CONTEXT CALIBRATION (subject + grade)
- Always interpret evidence in light of grade level and subject area.
- Younger (K–5): prioritize engagement, routines, presence over formal academic language.
- Middle/High (6–12): emphasize precision, academic vocabulary, independent participation.
- Mathematics: Cold Call & Wait Time often mean short factual checks—focus on distribution, clarity, and error analysis rather than long responses.
- Humanities/Language: emphasize elaboration, extended responses, textual evidence.
- Do NOT penalize developmentally typical responses; offer age-appropriate improvements.

TARGET ADJUSTMENT BY CONTEXT
- If grade ≤2: treat “Format Matters—Complete Sentences” as emerging if students respond in words/phrases while teacher models stems; coach using brief sentence starters.
- If grade ≤5: treat Wait Time target as 2–4s (instead of 3–5s); emphasize routines that prevent blurting and enable think time.
- For “100%—Universal Participation” in K–5: interpret as on-task signals (eyes, hands, partner talk) rather than only verbal turns.
- For Math: short, frequent checks are valid; focus coaching on distribution and clarity rather than response length.

CLASS CONTEXT
- Teacher: Guntars Dikis
- Class: test1
- Subject: English
- Grade: 11

WAIT-TIME METRICS (provided)
- Lesson span: 3935.78s; Speech: 2213.80s; Silence: 1721.98s (43.75%)
- Avg pause: 1.02s; Median: 0.48s; p90: 1.76s; Long (≥3s): 87; Longest: 52.75s
Use these to support the Wait Time criterion.

TRANSCRIPT (plain text):
Okay, it's four of us. Let's try to put our phones away in the box. How do you see the screen, Anna, in case you can actually use the presentation? As always. But we will need. We will need paper today. Either notebooks. Yeah. Or separate paper. But at the end we're gonna use phones to take a picture of it and upload it to Total. Okay. So we will have. Sorry. We will write. Yes, we will write. Who listened to the podcast generated by AI on teams? No one. I didn't see. I didn't think it was compulsory. It's not compulsory, it's just a help. And honestly I forgot because I even forget about some homework that they have and I found out because actually not everyone posts homework on polo. Sometimes you need to. Well, my homework is not mandatory, but it's gonna help you if you want to do good in this class. So I keep the responsibility on you. Yeah. To do it or not do it. Okay, so without further ado, I have to start the lesson because we are already late. So just to recap, we covered last time vision statement and mission statement. We looked at definitions of mission and vision statement. We looked at some key features. Why do companies need mission and vision statement? And today we will reflect on what we learned last time by writing an exam style question. Okay. Which is worth four marks. Four marks, meaning that in exam you have about eight minutes to write an answer. So while I'm doing attendance, I'm gonna go to next slide. But before that, just the objectives, the rest of the objectives for the class today we need to cover what are the common business objectives. Yeah. Or the aims of the companies. So some can be growth, could be profit, protecting shareholder value and ethical objectives. Then you see that we have two different categories for the objectives. They could be strategic and they could be tactical. And then of course a very important concept. You see the level of assessment objective, the higher the number going up to three, it's going to be deeper understanding. Okay. Good morning. We can put your phones here. Okay, so we will. We will try to touch upon the rest of the things. But now get your notebooks ready, open them up because you're gonna have to write. Yes, you're gonna have to practice writing exam style questions. Okay. Why are you two so late? Because we were finding class. Because we remember that we have only like in your and in carpenter room. Okay. So sorry. Okay. Try to write down for yourself, maybe in a notebook or in the calendar, like the number of the room where we meet. It's not on total. Yeah, it's not on total. Yeah, it's not on total. There is no the, like the room number. Okay. I'm going to. I'm going to make a note. Huh? Yeah. You have a memory with a bad emotion attached. Yeah, no, it's like I remember that I was the last thing. I remember that me and Alexandra were fighting class and we found this thing and I thought that maybe it's. Okay. All right, so I'm clicking the next slide and you can also go to the next slide. Just so you see. You see these four statements? Three of them are mission statements. One of them is vision statement. Okay, so just read through if you see it on the board or if you see it in your slides. 1.3. Yeah. So we. It's not the first one because we only covered. There's no 17 date refresh. Was it open already? When you open. So it's slide number eight. Yeah, slide number eight. Vision and mission statements. Ivan, did you read this? No. You don't have to write this. Okay. So I hope you read them. Okay. So the question, the exam question is with reference to the examples above, explain the role of vision and mission statements in business organizations. How do we approach this type of question? Yes. Okay. What do we have to do? We have a four mark question. Most of the time you will see that if it's a four mark question, it would usually tell you describe two or explain two or explain one advantage and explain one disadvantage. It right away gives you the idea, aha, I have to do two paragraphs because it says explain two or explain one on one. This time you see that it's asking for two things. For the mission statement and for the vision statement. No, mission is. So you already have a question. One second, wait. What exactly mission do we need to answer first? While Disney Co. Especially shows mission statement. So which exactly mission statement. That's the thing. You will always have a choice in business organizations. Yes. So in this case, you see that there are two things. I need a pen. Does anybody have apple pen or something like that? Or a pencil with a rubber band at the end because I don't want to scratch the screen. You do. Perfect. Because when I use the marker. Thank you. So we have a command term explain. And the command term explain falls into the category of AO2. Okay. AO2. And the definition for explain is to explain something means to give a detailed account of it including reasons or causes where appropriate. And then it gives example in this sheet. Yeah. So basically we need to give a detailed account of whatever is asked and what is asked today is explain the role of vision and mission statement. So we have number one here and number two here. So we know that we're going to put this answer in two paragraphs. And each of the paragraphs is going to have a structure of sel. Say explain and link. So what do we see in this text here is that we have three different mission statements, but only one vision statement. Which means that you're gonna have to link your vision statement answer to the Audi's. Okay, so we have all these vision statement and you will link it. Link to this one. Yeah. The second paragraph, you will explain a role of mission statement and then you can pick one of the three, whichever you like. So we will start with vision statement, all of us together. And I'll give you sentence starters for the structure of sel. Okay, don't rush to start the second paragraph yet. But if you want to, you can start the second paragraph when you're done with the first one by leaving a huge space between your two paragraphs. And later I will explain why you need that space when you organize your writing process in business management. Okay, so questions before we start writing, I have this much space. Would it be enough for one paragraph to ask the space or the start on the other page? Just. Just for the sake of practice. Yeah. So we will go to the next slide because I have an empty slide so I can write for you the example. Okay, so paragraph number one, paragraph, I'm going to write this. You can write it so it ingrains in your head, in your brain. But later you don't have to number your paragraphs. Okay. It's going to be in your system. So paragraph one, you will state, state. Okay. And you can separate it in three parts. So the statement goes. The role of vision statement int. So write what the role of vision statement is right now in your head. Meanwhile, open the glossaries. Open your glossaries and look at the terms we've learned so far up to 1.3. It's going to help you with the word bank. Yeah, you have to make it a live document uploaded to your drive. Whatever. You keep your documents. You should have a business management folder. Yes, you do. And do you have that glossary in there? No. Then upload it there. And then as you are working on your glossary, don't update it here, go update it in. Yes, yes. Okay, okay. Okay. So use your word bank. Use your glossary bank to write this first sentence. What is the role of vision statement? Yeah, the role of vision statement is to what inspire Write it, write it, write it, write it. I should start like the other. Is it like the. No, you continue here. Your. Your sentence, your own sentence. What did you understand from last lesson? I wonder. You weren't here. Yeah, well, your job was to go into the presentations and learn it on your own. I was like, I could subseate temperature. Okay. You could actually listen to podcasts I sent on teams to be on top of things when you're in teams. So. And then you simply state the role of vision statement. Yeah, it could be. The role of vision statement is. And you said to inspire. To inspire who? Or inspire. Inspire your costumes. It is. Yeah, it's a good guess. Yeah. So your statement doesn't have to be complicated, but the second part is going to be a little bit more complicated because you're now explaining this means that. So what does it mean? If you wrote that the role of vision statement is to inspire all stakeholders, for example, you would put a period and then say this means that it will help. What? Yeah. So you go ahead and you write what that means. It's. But what exactly should I explain? It depends what your status. See, you could have stopped here thanks to open by stating that is to inspire. And then you're already explaining what that means. So this is already your explanation. So instead of writing from start, this means that you could actually put that here. So to inspire all stakeholders, let's say. And then this means that it explains what your organization strives to be. Yeah. And then you can move this sentence starter to here the link end to try to make it sound. Do we have it? We have highlighters. If you want, you can highlight one color your statement, the other color your explanation. And now we're going to link it. We will link it. Wait, what I need to explain like my state. Like first of all, you explain the reason of having a vision statement. And we covered that last time. So if you have your computer, you could have it in front of you. He's going to do push ups next time. You don't have a computer. I have. You have your computer because you have to look for information in this class. You could ask maybe Dash, if you could share a definition of vision statement. No, I don't need. Because yes, you do need a definition because this. How to explain it? This goes. Is that. Exactly. We talked about it last time. And if you look at the vision statement, you could actually have some ideas how to explain it. No, that is not a definition. It's the definition for Audi. But maybe you could share the definition of vision statement because it is different from mission statement. What's the problem on the previous slide, like slide number 8? Can you refresh it? Because if your tab was open from last time, I made some changes. So. Okay, so now your next sentence of linking it back to the case study. So this is our case study. You can quote all these vision statements and say in the case of whatever you wrote, I don't know what you wrote, but hopefully you talked about the fact that vision statement is to inspire maybe all stakeholders. This means that by knowing the vision of a company, how does it help the company? Okay. Or stakeholders around it. And then in the case of Audi's vision statement, which is what Ahmedi, the premium brand. Audi, the premium brand. Audi, the premium brand. And now try to put these two things or three things together. The statement they explain and now link it to specific vision statement of Audi. What is Audi trying to say? And then in the case of vision statement, I can say the statement after the organization, the brand was trying to. Is trying to. The brand is trying to inspire their customers probably to purchase, knowing that they're purchasing a premium car. And everything that they will do in the future is for you customers or for you employees to know that what we're doing here, we're making premium luxury cars. Yeah, it has shifted a bit when I sat in Audi bolt car, which is not the best they can give us, but they're trying to offer a little bit cheaper versions of Audi nowadays. But it used to be that Audi is really trying to give us these premium cars. Yeah, their strategies have changed and we will talk throughout these two years. What do companies do to cut costs? And there are several strategies, but I'm going to let you think what to write. So in the case of Audi's vision statement, blah, blah, blah, whatever it is about premium cars, what is the message they're trying to bring about? But for example, if I will have a question like this on the exam, it is four marks. So for four marks I need two paragraphs. Three sentences is enough for one paragraph usually. Yes, yes. Some people can do it in two sentences because they put the explain and link at the same time. But as we're learning to write, we will split this. First you will get into the flow and you'll understand how to organize your thoughts. Is everybody done with this? Yes, you are. Ivan is not. I give you one more minute. The only difference I'm going to change now in case of all your. Paragraph number two is similar, except you're explaining the role of mission Statement in general terms, the role of mission statement. Should I like have a distance between them? Yes, you have to have a space between your first and second paragraph. Because you will see when I will grade your papers. I need that space. I need to see whether you know that you are organized. No. Yeah, yeah. Not that big of a space. Usually it's just one line. Yeah, usually a one line. You're doing the same thing. But now you could choose which company's mission statement you want to pick and then write about it and make sure you're clear about it. What you need to do now you leave a space and write a second paragraph. You can number it paragraph number two. You will now write about the role of mission statement. Because just now you wrote about vision statement. You didn't finish yet the first one, right? Yeah, I understand how to write. You don't. No, I understand how to write. So we just have like S E T. Wait, S E L. And you write in this kind of task. You write basis format. So now write about mission statement. Come and see. You could put it together. It is easier to use more closer terms as you're writing because one second, if you will use glossary terms, you don't have to explain yourself too long because if you use the proper word from business management terminology, you can shorten your writing. Because if the person who comes from global politics class, they may not even understand even now what are you writing about. Because you use business management terminology. Yeah. Cuz they may not know the difference between customer and consumer. Use those terms as you're right. Helps also attract customers. The rest of mission statement. This means that. This means that at all. Not only. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it is to. To like. Let's see. Can we check definition? I don't know. Could you go to think in thinking you could. You can go back to. You can actually go back to the slide. There you go. Yeah, there you go. Yes, basically the same. Yeah. But no, it's not the same because you wrote about future here. Right. Something achievement in the future. Now this one mission statement is something you do every day. What does the company do every day? Because it's also the role of mission statement is to demonstrate who the organizations are, why they exist, who they are and what they do. That's all. Yeah. Because you're not really defining, you're explaining what mission statement is. Yeah. And what they're trying to do them or who they are. Then you say this means that. Okay, you're just practicing. What does it mean? This means that the mission Statement should provide. This means that. Now you could explain. This means that from the mission statement, you should get the idea. You should get the idea how to. Or you should get the idea how do organizations. How do organizations not interact? Yeah. Or what do they practice on a regular day to achieve their. You can actually say to achieve their vision statements. Trying to attract or not attract. This is to help achieve vision statement. That's the main thing of mission statement. Because mission. Remember guys, mission statement is what they're aiming is what is what they're doing to achieve their vision. Yeah. Because vision is what they're. What they're guided by in general. Mission is what they have to do to achieve that vision in the future. Yes. PepsiCo is Pepsi Cola. Yeah, probably. Yeah. Pepsi Cola is the dream. But PepsiCo is the company that owns all these brands. Mountain Dew, seven Up. Pepsi Cola or just Pepsi. Sprite. No, Coca Cola owns Sprite. Fanta. Yeah. There's a distinction. Their biggest rivals. Ashwips. I think it's Coca Colas. Bonaqua is Coca Cola. It's water. Exactly. Oh, there's so much to learn about these countries. Companies screen. I'm blind. Take a look. Yeah, you think? Okay. Are you done? No, no. Come on, you got to finish. Are you done? Okay. Before I look at your pages and your papers, exchange it with your friend that sits next to you. If it's how many of us? Four, nine. Okay. We're gonna have to. You will guys, rotate your papers clockwise. Yeah. You'll give yours to Ivan. Ivan is going to give to Sasha and Sasha to dash. And now you need an example in the case of which. So choose one. Whether Walt Disney's mission statement and link it back to that mission statement. How. How do you think they will. Okay. How do you think they demonstrate their mission statement? Do they demonstrate it well? Yeah. Which one are you gonna think to provide consumers around? Make. To provide consumers like it doesn't talk about advertisements. It wants to. Because you see, this means that what you're writing. Organizations can understand how to show who they are. And how do they show who they are? In Turkey, they provide consumers around the world with delicious, affordable, convenience, complementary foods and beverages. From wholesome breakfast to healthy and fun daytime snacks and beverages. People buy it in shops, but you have to refer what exactly is said in this statement? You can shorten this mission statement while you're linking it. You can say that show who they are. And they are. Pepsi is a company that provides delicious, affordable and convenient. What are the keywords in their mission statement? They provide their consumers with delicious, affordable and convenient foods and beverages. Which is other Pepsi also sell food. So basically you shorten, you kind of repeat what's in the mission statement and then you can analyze, you can already start analyzing. Like how does according to the definition of mission statement, are they saying in this mission statement who they are? Do you agree that they see in mission statement they're supposed to show you who they are, what they do and why they exist? Does this sentence provide that information from Pepsi? Yeah, I mean at least show me as an examiner that you understand that they are trying to show who they are or by saying that they provide consumers around the world with the wishes of convenient. You have to explain and link. But here you have to. Yeah, they do who they are or what they do. It's better to what they do because they provide. See what they do. They provide. They do by saying that they provide consumers with these drinks. Say sometimes you won't have enough time to explain too long. As long as you make the point. No, but I feel like that's just because I'm like repeating everything right in here and like the only part is different experience. For now it's okay because when you will be writing these four mark questions in the future, you'll see where you can make a shortcut by using proper terminology. Every test will be pass papers. Tomorrow we probably going to try to finish 1.3 already start the business plan. Business management. There's a category of different tools in the business management syllabus that you need to know about. Because you will be applying these tools in your analysis in your essay writings. And one of them is business plans. Since we've covered three first topics of business management, we can actually now build on that to be able to create the business plan and understand why companies need a business plan. Sorry, do I have asa? No, but I have consultation. It's by appointment, usually on the days when we have lessons. Okay, I hope everybody is done. Now let's switch the notebooks. You already switched one. Okay, switch back now. And now your friend is going to highlight any term that you used from glossary. Try to read through. Girls, switch again. I don't know. Did you switch with each other already? Now switch. Read it through, see what you think about it. And if you have a highlighter now highlight or underline every term that she used from boss hair. Try to find business management terms. Okay, let's do a swap. Let's swap it around. Don't worry about you. Give it to Ivan. Ivan gives his to Sasha and Sasha. And now you will try to find the business management terms from glossary that your friend used in his writing or her writing. Okay. Try to see whether their text is all up. Let's see who is the winner. I know it's hard to put all of this together now, but let's see how you did. Can I highlight it or. Yes, you highlight it. Yes, you can. I'm letting you. Yes, it's a. It's a practice exercise. Do you have a highlighter? I didn't bring it this size. Yeah. I want to see who is the winner here today. The most business management firms. Okay. Finally there is a glossary. Oh, that. That's the part of learning you're looking for terms whether dash a highlighter. What else could your health management. I don't have any. Then underline. Then underline. Underline. Yeah. And count. Okay, I'm going to delete this. Not definitions. Terms that you had to learn definitions for. By now you should. You should already know about what 30 or 40 definitions. Do we have term organization. Because. No, I don't think it can now. Business end businesses. Yeah, let's see. Key terms. Yes, let's do this one. I will create. I don't know, you guys. It was a 10 minute recap of vision and mission statements. Did you listen to it? So 9. So listen to that. If that's the learning you like to learn by listening or instead of going into the presentation. Because first you have to prove to me that you've tried to understand it, you will tell me. I read through your presentations. I read through in thinking. I watched all the videos. Ms. Lea, I still don't get it. If I see napkins where you cried with tears and you didn't understand. You need to prove me that you tried your best to understand yourself. Okay. That's how we're learning to be independent learners. And then if you don't get it, I'm going to come and devote that time with you. We're going to look at the objectives. Yeah. And finish that. And then business plan is going to be. Okay. Start to look for the terms. Okay. Now I. Are you done finding terms? How many did. Thirteen. All right. Not good. Well, in the future it will be also how many? All right, so see, we will work on that. We will work on filling text with business terminology. Okay, so let's say how many terms do you have without mentioning the actual vision statement and mission statement. Because we are talking about the vision and mission statements. So let's take that out. Get your Paper back and see how well did you do? What could you improve? What could you improve? And if it's a vision statement, it basically. So I want other like goods, customers, consumers, owners, employees, maybe. Yeah, Although we don't have owners. In the future you will though produce. Produce. Yeah, production. Maybe if heaven produce goods and services. So there's non businesses would be a better term. Because there is a definition. It doesn't understand that if you already have that in your writing. Okay. All right, so this is how we practice. It took some time, but every time we're gonna do another one, it's gonna get faster. Okay. So just remember. State, explain, link. State, explain, link. Okay, so we will go to the next slide because we have to talk about other things. We have to talk about business objectives. Okay, so what is the definition for business objectives? Who would like to read this? Dasha, please. Business objectives, or simply objectives are the clearly defined, measurable targets of an organization used to achieve its overall goals. Okay, so every organization needs clearly defined and measurable targets. Yeah. Or goals. Somebody actually had goals in their writing. Yeah, targets used to achieve its overall goals, also goals. So how. First of all, there's this huge goal. Kind of. Yeah, the mid vision statement. Then we have these middle mission statements. So objectives probably will be something that will help you either achieve your mission or vision or both. Yeah. So usually the company will have set targets and overall goals. So you see, we have idea. We have planning, strategy and success. How do we get from idea to success? We need to plan, then we create a strategy and then we're successful. Okay, but it all starts with the idea. It all starts with a vision of where we want to be. Okay, so look at that. Common business objectives. Firms mission and vision statements serve to guide the organization's strategies and strategic objectives. This is how it all blends together. To achieve our vision and mission, we need a plan. And that's why the next thing that we will be talking about will be a business plan. And that will be your first business management tool. Okay, so you got that definition down. It's clear. Yes. The presentation is on Toddle. Okay. Have you heard of smart? Anna and Amelia, have you heard of smart goals? Of course. Have you? Ivan, have you heard of smart goals? It's after Peter Drucker. It's also there. Smart. Yeah. Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time specific. Okay, so look at that. What is the difference between the aims, the overall goals? They're called aims. Yeah, you're aiming it. You're aiming it in the aim. And how to do that we create objectives. These are short term goals. And aims are medium to long term goals. So let's say Ivan, you would like to get a 7 in business management. That is your ultimate goal. Your aim. Your aim is to get a seven. But to get a seven you have to create smaller goals and they're called objectives. Okay. They will be shorter term goals that you will come to class prepared. Number one objective with the computer, you will come with the charger. There could be all different kinds of small objectives. Tomorrow? Yeah, tomorrow you'll be ready. Tomorrow you will study business management terms to do well on business tests. When is it? October 6th. Okay. I still haven't put it up. Another objective would be do past papers on your own. Another objective could be create a study session with me by appointment at school. Like Sasha would wanted to do. Yeah. So those would be your smaller. Every organization sets a goal. We want to be market leader. That's their aim. How do we achieve being a market leader? Let's talk to marketing, let's talk to finances, let's talk to operations management and let's talk to human resources. So this is a big picture of how we achieve one common goal aimed. Okay. Is this clear? So why, why do companies need objectives similarly to why they need a mission statement? Yeah. They need to know where they're striving to go. They need to have a sense of purpose. We actually, as a Mixupari International school have aims and objectives. Like what? What are we doing to achieve our mission? Yeah. So we have to have common goal. Where? This year our goal was to encourage you to take notes. Did you feel that from every teacher? Yeah. So also to promote a greater sense of belonging. Yeah. To measure progress. Because I could also look at my previous year's exams that my students had. What were their grades? I measure. I measure my success. How much would you grade? Grade 12. Last year we had SL student. My first student who ever got a set 7 and it was an SL student. My HL students highest grades were sixes, but I had. Nobody was below three. But three was the weakest student ever. That is not a. No, no, no. Don't tell that. No, no, no. But that was the weakest student because I thought maybe the weakest student will have a one, but he ended up having a three. No, he was gonna have a bad mark. So it's not like he studied for two years for five and six and then he got a three on exam. No, no. That's what I predicted. Yeah. So my predictions were pretty accurate. This Year I actually had predicted some students to be lower and they surprised me and they had a higher grade. So it was a nice surprise too, you know, so. And only SL got seven. Only SL got one. Seven. Yes. My first. Okay, so we are measuring companies measure progress. Okay. But what you have to ingrain in your head, you need to. What are the common business objectives? And they are four. Okay, four common business objectives. Growth, profit, protecting shareholder value and ethical objectives. What do you think? I think growth and profit is probably self explanatory. But what could it mean to protect shareholders value? If you are a large organization, why would companies common objective across all possible profit making companies in the world want. Why would you want as an organization to protect shareholders? Value. Value. You mean value as a person or value that he invested? Huh? Good question. Probably both. I would say both because he's like important figure of the business and like he invests and of course like organizations and like create like entrepreneurs would love to protect somebody who's like helping them or helped them. Yes, usually shareholders. Are they actively participating in daily activities of a company? No, not necessarily. Usually not. But how could you. Why would you want to protect the shareholder value? Because of some kind of also ethical objectives. This token somehow be mixed, I think because like he helped you and. But it also depends on the person. What does he get? What does shareholder get out of a company? If they invest in percentage in form of dividends, they receive dividends. And they also, if they could ever decide to share, to sell their shares. If it's a privately held company, they could just opt out. They said that's it, I'm no longer a shareholder, I want to sell my share. So in the privately held companies, you want to protect the shareholders value because it's such a private company, you don't want that person to go out and be. You become vulnerable because your shareholder just left. They may leave and say, you know, reveal things about the company that you don't want to be relieved. Revealed. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, yeah, yeah, it's gonna come back again. And of course common objectives. You have to remain ethical. There will be objectives that companies and organizations and businesses will set because they want to be viewed ethical. Therefore they create ethical objectives. So here we're going to talk about each of them. Yeah. Growth, the objective to grow refers to increase in size of a business and its operations. Okay. Why would somebody want to grow? Why would somebody won't want to grow what you're saying? Companies common objective. The first one is growth. Most of the companies they're ambitious. They want to grow. But who would be a person who would not want to grow? Like simple minded, like person which do do his business, like for his not to survive. Yeah, in life. But he already had money. And she just did it as a hobby. Yeah, as a hobby. For example. No. Detailing cars. I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like having a business as a hobby. And some people really, they don't need a lot. They don't want to deal with management, they don't want to deal with hiring, firing people. They just do their little small business. It's enough for them. Revenue formula for revenue is price times quantity. So if you're selling 10 iPhones, you will multiply 10 by the price of iPhones and you'll get the revenue. Is it prebi in Russian? Revenue or prebig is profit. So what is revenue then in Russia? Yes. Okay. Yeah. So we want higher sales revenue. It's something that comes into your organization after providing good. Good or service. But profit stays after you get paid. When you pay all the expenses, all the cost of goods sold. Yeah. You pay taxes and interest, you have profit left. And even sometimes from the retained profit, you pay dividends, which is. You will see that there will be different dividends you pay to the shareholders, taxes you pay to. Yes, taxes you pay to government. Later we will talk about what economies of scale is. But basically it means that these are cost saving benefits for firms as they grow larger. So let's say you're making 10 pizzas, you go to buy, you know, maybe a few kilograms of flour. The price for three kilograms is going to be more expensive per kilo than if you went and bought 100 kilos. So when you buy larger amounts of raw materials, your price per kilo usually gets smaller. That's called economies of scale in simple terms. So the larger the company, the cheaper you get raw materials. Okay, so we'll touch on that in 1.4 in the greater, greater detail, reduced risks. The larger the firm, the less vulnerable they are to changes in external environment. Because they operate in many different areas of business, they may sell things, they may provide services. So the more differentiated the business is, the less risky each operation becomes, because one can rely on the other. If I'm not good with sales, if I'm Apple, I still can rely on Apple services. That's where the money is coming in. Yeah. So the larger you grow, the larger you grow, the less risky it becomes. Yeah. Okay. We also will talk about internal and external growth. And this is where you learn the definitions of Both of these. So I'm going to let you. I think tomorrow we will finish this presentation. 1.3. I can finish it today at home. You can finish it today at home. This is the last thing we talk about today. Because these will be exam questions. Differentiate, Distinguish between internal and external growth. So what is internal growth? Internal growth means. I'm gonna just go back. So it takes place when organization expands. Hold on. Without the help of an external partner firm. So the internal growth is you have your own money without any investment, without anybody else, but specifically without any other company. Even if you have investor, a private investor that invests in your company, that is still internal growth. Yes, because see, the definition says without the help of an external partner firm. Highlight that with big letters. Because all throughout four years of my teaching students at the end of the year still couldn't distinguish between internal and external growth. And it was. I was so sad. So I'm gonna make you remember this. We're gonna go over this. Can you go down, down. Click here. Since you're missing. It's probably going to be everything. We're going to cover tomorrow. All of this. Yeah. These are just your first questions. So the whole presentation and that's it. So there would be no new. No, I don't think so. Yeah. Okay, great. So. So just finishing 1.3. Yes. Okay. Please, please, please remember this key sentence. So what do they do instead without having another firm involved in their growth? They use their own resources to grow. They use retained profits to invest in production facilities or in new locations or. Yeah. Another shop, another store, another showroom or another factory. They use their own profits, including outside investor individuals. Yes, they do. But not firms. Because you will see the difference between internal and external growth. Yeah. So external growth, as you see, it's the opposite. The Stop, stop, stop. We still have one minute. One minute, one minute. What is external growth? It's called also an inorganic. This is organic. And this is. Yeah, inorganic. It refers to the expansion and evolution of business using third party resources and organizations rather than relying on internal sources and activities. And here will be the question about the investors. Although it says third party resources, investors count as a third party resource. According to business management syllabus, external growth methods will be only when you have a merger, acquisition, takeover between another company. So let's stick to that definition. In real life, it could be that investors also might be considered. But let's just forget about that. For these two reasons are not third party. I'm gonna check. Yeah, I actually want to see what the thinka this is because usually we stick to external growth as having another company merging or taking over or you. Your company being acquired by another company. Me? Yeah. Because in the top definition, it says external partner firm. If. If it's collaboration, it's external partnerships. Yeah. Partnerships with other. Yeah. We'll talk about. All right. Take a picture with your phone of your writing that you did today and upload it on Toddle. Yeah. Very serious. No, no, no, it's okay. Take pride. You sat there and you roll. Yeah. And now. And I'm going to sit in the evening. I like that golf mindset. Bye. Go to Business Management. Here, this one. And add response and take a picture.
