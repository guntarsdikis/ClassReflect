# Recording Tips

These quick tips help ensure reliable in‑browser recordings across devices:

- Allow microphone permissions when prompted. If denied, reload and allow.
- Say a short test phrase and observe the mic level meter before starting.
- On mobile, keep the screen awake (avoid auto‑lock) during recording.
- Stay close to the microphone; avoid covering it with hands or cases.
- Prefer stable Wi‑Fi; if the connection is weak, finish recording and let the upload complete before navigating away.
- If you encounter issues, switch to the “Upload File” tab and use your phone’s built‑in recorder, then upload the file.

Advanced
- iOS Safari cannot record with the screen locked; keep the device awake during sessions.
- Large sessions may take longer to upload; do not close the tab while uploading.
