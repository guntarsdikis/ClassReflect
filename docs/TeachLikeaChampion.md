# ClassReflect: "Teach Like a Champion" Analysis Framework

**Version**: 2.0  
**Integration**: AssemblyAI + LeMUR + "Teach Like a Champion" Principles  
**Target**: Evidence-based teacher development using Doug Lemov's research  
**Objective**: Transform classroom audio into actionable teaching insights based on proven techniques

---

## Framework Overview

### Core Philosophy
"Teach Like a Champion" provides 62+ specific, measurable teaching techniques that have been proven to increase student achievement. ClassReflect analyzes classroom audio to identify, measure, and provide feedback on these techniques, giving teachers data-driven insights for professional growth.

### Value Proposition
Instead of generic feedback like "talk less," teachers receive specific, actionable insights such as:
- "Your Cold Call distribution improved 23% this month"
- "Wait Time averaging 2.1 seconds - increase to 3.5 seconds for deeper thinking"
- "No Opt Out success rate: 85% - 3 missed opportunities identified with timestamps"

### Integration Approach
**Single-Service Solution**: AssemblyAI LeMUR analyzes transcripts using custom prompts based on "Teach Like a Champion" techniques, providing immediate, structured feedback without requiring multiple AI services.

## Core Teaching Techniques for Audio Analysis

### Tier 1: Foundation Techniques (Always Analyzed)

#### 1. Cold Call
**Definition**: Calling on students regardless of whether they raise their hand, creating a culture where all students are expected to participate.

**Audio Analysis Markers**:
- Teacher says student name followed by question without "hands up" context
- Questions directed to specific students rather than open calls
- Distribution pattern across different student voices

**Measurement Criteria**:
- **Frequency**: Total cold calls per lesson
- **Distribution**: Percentage of students called upon
- **Timing**: Cold calls throughout lesson vs clustered
- **Effectiveness**: Student response quality to cold calls

**Success Metrics**:
- Target: 8-12 cold calls per 45-minute lesson
- Distribution: 60%+ of students called at least once
- Response rate: 90%+ of cold calls receive substantive answers

**Feedback Examples**:
- "Excellent cold call distribution - 14 different students engaged"
- "Cold calls clustered in first 10 minutes - spread throughout lesson"
- "Marcus gave strong response to unexpected question at 23:15"

#### 2. Wait Time
**Definition**: Intentional pause after asking a question to give students time to think before responding.

**Audio Analysis Markers**:
- Silence duration between question and teacher calling on student
- Pause length between question and student response
- Teacher patience vs rushing to fill silence

**Measurement Criteria**:
- **Average wait time**: Mean pause length after questions
- **Consistency**: Standard deviation of wait times
- **Minimum threshold**: Percentage of questions with 3+ second wait time
- **Maximum patience**: Longest wait time used

**Success Metrics**:
- Target: 3-5 seconds average wait time
- Consistency: 80%+ of questions meet minimum threshold
- Range: 2-8 seconds depending on question complexity

**Feedback Examples**:
- "Wait time improved from 1.8 to 3.2 seconds this month"
- "Question at 15:30 - excellent 6-second wait time led to thoughtful response"
- "8 questions rushed with <2 second wait time - missed thinking opportunities"

#### 3. No Opt Out
**Definition**: When a student says "I don't know" or gives an incorrect answer, the teacher ensures they eventually provide a correct response rather than moving on to another student.

**Audio Analysis Markers**:
- Student responses: "I don't know," "I'm not sure," incorrect answers
- Teacher follow-up patterns after opt-out attempts
- Return to original student after getting correct answer from others
- Scaffolding and support provided to struggling students

**Measurement Criteria**:
- **Opt-out instances**: Total attempts to avoid answering
- **Resolution rate**: Percentage of opt-outs successfully resolved
- **Method variety**: Different approaches used (hint, simpler question, peer help)
- **Follow-through**: Returning to original student with correct answer

**Success Metrics**:
- Target: 95%+ opt-out resolution rate
- Method diversity: 3+ different support strategies used
- Time investment: Average 45-90 seconds per opt-out resolution

**Feedback Examples**:
- "Perfect No Opt Out - all 4 instances resolved successfully"
- "Sarah's 'I don't know' at 18:45 - excellent scaffolding led to correct answer"
- "Missed opportunity with Jake at 31:20 - moved to next student too quickly"

#### 4. Right is Right
**Definition**: Holding students accountable for fully correct answers rather than accepting partially correct or imprecise responses.

**Audio Analysis Markers**:
- Teacher responses to student answers: "Not quite," "Almost," "Can you be more specific?"
- Requests for precision, complete answers, or proper terminology
- Follow-up questions demanding accuracy
- Acceptance vs rejection of "close enough" answers

**Measurement Criteria**:
- **Precision requests**: Frequency of demanding more accurate answers
- **Standard maintenance**: Consistency in holding high expectations
- **Missed opportunities**: Partially correct answers accepted without pushback
- **Student growth**: Improvement in answer quality throughout lesson

**Success Metrics**:
- Target: 70%+ of imprecise answers receive precision requests
- Consistency: Standards maintained throughout entire lesson
- Growth evidence: Students self-correct by lesson end

**Feedback Examples**:
- "Strong precision at 12:15 - pushed Emma beyond 'sort of' to exact explanation"
- "3 missed Right is Right opportunities in math problem section"
- "Students increasingly self-correcting by lesson end - excellent standard setting"

#### 5. Format Matters
**Definition**: Requiring students to answer in complete sentences, use proper grammar, and employ academic vocabulary.

**Audio Analysis Markers**:
- Student responses in complete vs incomplete sentences
- Teacher requests for proper format: "Can you say that in a complete sentence?"
- Academic vocabulary usage vs casual language
- Grammar corrections and language precision

**Measurement Criteria**:
- **Complete sentences**: Percentage of student responses in proper format
- **Format requests**: Teacher interventions for better language

**Definition**: Asking follow-up questions after correct answers to extend and deepen student thinking.

**Audio Analysis Markers**:
- Follow-up questions after correct answers: "Why?" "How do you know?" "What makes you think that?"
- Extension questions connecting to broader concepts
- Requests for additional examples or applications
- Building on student responses rather than simply accepting them

**Measurement Criteria**:
- **Stretch frequency**: Follow-up questions per correct answer
