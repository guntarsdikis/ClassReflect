  can you check why it says audio job failed for the 4771b246-8486-43da-bbcb-864c48d4be52
  but status was given before file was completed, why is that? it just a guess, but maybe when files are uploaded, maybe need to rename them locally as well. the transcript at the end was created successfully, it took more time, that is it. can you check why it updated status failed for the job, if job was not completed yet. think


categories should be manageable, each school should be able to create their own categories. superadmin and school manager should be able to create categories. think

template does not update to belong to the school, can you fix it? think

password reset check?
