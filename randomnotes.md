i would like to create template which would go along the principles from the "Teach Like a Champion" book, how do i do it? can you help me with this? think

i dont think http://localhost:3000/admin/jobs is needed in superadmin, and where I can see files which are processing and how will assemblyai will return results, or should i get results myself?

based on changes in app due to implementing assemblyai, can you check does all tables in database for project is still used and check unused services which can be cleaned up. for example: can you remove s3 acesss script and also ec2 automatic starting for whisperer process? check AWS CLI access to default profile. think

what for is table analysis_criteria? i dont think it is used. think

can you make sure superadmin dashboard, manager dashboard teacher dashboard does not have mock data showing. if there is nothing to show then comming soon should be displayed. 

can you sort out all files in /Users/guntarsdikis/websites/ClassReflect/ directory. please check if .sh files are still needed, if needed then move to appropriate directory. also md files if revelant then move to docs folder and test- files maybe not needed anymore, lets do major clean up. think
