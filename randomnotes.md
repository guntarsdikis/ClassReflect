how to implement in our current app "Teach Like a Champion" principles. here is the documentation. docs/TeachLikeaChampion.md
you have to check our current app settings and suggest what is best option to integrate it. is it by using template criterions? i dont want hard coded, i want to be able to apply template of "teach like a champion" but also there can be other templates. so to one transcript can be applied different templates. basically templates have finetuned prompts, the list of prompts, which are criterions, how would you suggest update current app. think


can you make record details column to be more informative in http://localhost:3000/analysis? think
and can you make recordings deleteable?
